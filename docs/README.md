# Documentation Assets

This directory contains documentation assets for the project README.

## Image Placeholders

The following images should be added to `docs/images/`:

- `landing-page.png` - Screenshot of the landing page
- `application-wizard.png` - Screenshot of the application wizard
- `dashboard.png` - Screenshot of the dashboard/results view
- `recommendations.png` - Screenshot of the recommendations page
- `financial-charts.png` - Screenshot of financial charts visualization

## Demo Video

Add your demo video to one of these locations:

1. **YouTube/Vimeo**: Upload and use the embed URL in README.md
2. **Local file**: Place in `docs/demo-video.mp4` and update README.md
3. **GitHub Releases**: Upload as a release asset and link to it

## Image Guidelines

- **Format**: PNG or JPG
- **Size**: Recommended 1200x800px or similar aspect ratio
- **Quality**: High resolution for clarity
- **File size**: Optimize for web (under 500KB per image if possible)

## Updating README.md

After adding images, update the image paths in the main `README.md` file:

```markdown
![Landing Page](docs/images/landing-page.png)
```

Replace the placeholder paths with your actual image paths.
